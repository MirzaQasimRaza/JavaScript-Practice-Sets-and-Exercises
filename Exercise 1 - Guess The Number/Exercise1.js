/*
    Question Ex1 :

    Write a Javascript program to generate a random number and store it in a variable. The program then takes an input
    from the user to tell them whether the guess was Correct, greater or lesser than the original number.
    100 - (no of guesses) is the score of the user. The program is expected to terminate once the number is guessed.
    Number should be between 1 - 100
